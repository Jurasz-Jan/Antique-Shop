## Setting your own MongoDB cluster
As this project works in the MongoDB in cloud, it requires the user- if he does want to run it locally, of course- to use his own MongoDB connection string. You can get it for free on cloud.mongodb.com by creating a free cluster.

Then you need to edit /backend/config.js file ->  mongoURI variable,and change it to your valid connection string.


## How to run it?

In terminal window use following commands:
##### cd backend
##### npm i
##### npm run dev

In second terminal window:
##### cd frontend/store
##### npm i
##### npm run dev
